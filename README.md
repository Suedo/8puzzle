Finds the best combination of turns to win at 8-puzzle , a sliding cell board game.<br/>

<p>
This is an assignment from a <strong>Coursera</strong> algorithms course that i'vparticipated in.<br/> 
</p>

the program can handle (given sufficient memory) any size of puzzle , But we call it 8-puzzle after the actual 
popular board game.


Dependencies : Stdlib.jar , algs4.jar : two specific libraries provided from princeton.
(i think i already have those commited in the older repositories , if not , they can be found here : http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).
