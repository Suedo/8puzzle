8puzzle
=======

Finds the best combination of turns to win at 8-puzzle , a sliding cell board game.
Try the game here : http://mypuzzle.org/sliding<br/>
This was an assignment from a coursera algorithm course that i'm taking. 
One reason why the api is like the way it is is because we have to follow an exact instruction set on what all 
resources we can use , and exactly how the api should be. (Any deviation leads to loss of credit).

Note : the program can handle (given sufficient memory) any size of puzzle , But we call it 8-puzzle after the actual 
popular board game.


Dependencies : Stdlib.jar , algs4.jar : two specific libraries that we have to use for basic io etc stuff.
(i think i already have those commited in the older repositories , if not , they can be found here : http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
along with a ton of other real good stuff ).
